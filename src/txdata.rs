/// Intuitively, we can think of an SPL confidential token account as a regular SPL token account
/// but where the token amount is wrapped inside commitments. We can intuitively think of
/// commitments as an encryption of the token amount. In this prototype code, we specifically use
/// Pedersen commitments, which consists of a single 32-byte compressed Ristretto point.
///
/// The use of Pedersen commitments is standard for settings where confidentiality, but not
/// anonymity (hiding the TX graph), is of concern. For settings where we want both confidentiality
/// and anonymity, we would use El Gamal, which consists of two 32-byte compressed Ristretto
/// points.
///
/// Since token amounts are wrapped inside commitments, complications do arise in how we want to
/// manage these accounts regarding issues like rent. For the prototype code, we put these issues
/// aside and focus on transaction verification since we are primarily interested in the cost of
/// these verifications.
///
/// A transaction consists of a vector of input commitments and output commitments (for the
/// prototype code, we use an array of fixed size 2 for simplicity). An input commitment is a
/// commitment held by one of the existing accounts. An output commitment is a commitment that is
/// newly created by the transaction.
///
/// For transaction verification, we must verify the following:
/// 1. Are the input commitments valid?
///
///     Given that input commitments are just output commitments that were produced in previous
///     transactions, we can forgo input verification given that output commitments are verified
///     correctly.
///
/// 2. Are the output commitments valid?
///
///     Output verification consist of verifying that the commitments are valid Pedersen
///     commitments that wrap values in the range [0, 2^64]. This is done by range proofs in
///     Bulletproofs.
///
/// 3. Are the input and output commitments consistent?
///
///     Consistency verification consist of verifying that the sum of the values inside the input
///     commitments are equal to the sum of the values inside the output commitments. This is done
///     by a custom proof-of-knowledge verification algorithm in proof.rs.
///
/// The proof-of-knowledge verification is essentially the cost of doing one Ed25519 signature
/// verification. The bulk of the verification will be verifying the range proofs, which should
/// require around 64*2 elliptic curve multiplication on Ristretto points (though each of these
/// multiplications are largely independent and hence parallelizable operations).
///
/// Notes on one-time usage of accounts:
///     - To prevent issues like front-running, an account is one-time-use per transaction. For
///     example, suppose that an account with address [pk] holds a commitment [comm]. When the user
///     spends tokens from this account, even if there are tokens left over from the transaction,
///     the user must create a new account [pk'] with the new commitment [comm'] and purge the
///     original account. There are other ways to prevent issues like front-running, but for the
///     purpose of the prototype code, we make accounts one-time-use per transaction.
///
///     - An optimization (from MimbleWimble) that can be made is to replace [pk] with the
///     commitment [comm]. Public keys and Pedersen commitments are all 32-bytes, and Pedersen
///     commitments are also randomly generated (and hence, collisions are highly unlikely). This
///     is quite natural when combined with the point above that accounts are one-time-use since
///     commitments constantly change with transactions (and hence, addresses constantly change).
///     for the prototype code, this optimization is not made to prevent possible confusion.
